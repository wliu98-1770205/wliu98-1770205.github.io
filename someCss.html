<p class="ex1">Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman called the NFL's concussion protocol an "absolute joke" and said the policy is more for public relations than to actually protect the players. "It's for public opinion, for them to show the public that they care about the players, they care about player safety," Sherman said in a Players Tribune video posted Thursday. "In a show of good faith and goodwill, they said we're going to have an independent trauma expert, an independent neurologist, approve people, and the same things are happening that were happening before."</p>
<p class="ex2">"The NFL and NFLPA recognize that Mr. Savage's return to the game did not reflect the expected outcome of the Protocol," a statement read. "As such, the parties have agreed that no discipline will be assessed, but have already implemented several improvements to the Protocol to prevent such an unacceptable outcome in the future." Sherman said the league, not the Texans, should face criticism for its "independent" policy. He also indicated he would not be donating his brain to science after his death. The Seahawks were fined $100,000 for not following concussion protocol in a November game against the Arizona Cardinals.  Quarterback Russell Wilson missed just one play and was not examined for a concussion after he took a hit from Cardinals linebacker Karlos Dansby. </p>
